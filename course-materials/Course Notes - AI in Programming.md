## Trends 2025–2026 and what to expect next

- Knowledge base on latest trends: [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/5a69e473-2453-4ee7-bcb6-866af29ba553)
- **Vibe Codding vs Vibe Engineering**
  - Linus Torvalds, DHH, and Node.js creator use automated code generation, e.g.:
    - "[the era of humans writing code is over.](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2013524952553492933)" (Node.js creator on AI generating code)
  - Microsoft named their new Power Apps platform Vibe - we prompt to build apps: [Vibe - Power Apps](https://vibe.powerapps.com/) (only in US right now) | Docs: [Omówienie nowego środowiska usługi Power Apps - Power Apps | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/pl-pl/power-apps/vibe/overview)
  - Vibe Coding definition: [X.com](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?lang=en)
- **Context rot & Context engineering**
- **Async Codding Agents in Cloud & on Mobile**
- CLI tools, Automation (Auto Review, Auto Mode, Schedules/Rutines, Loops), YOLO in container/cloud or local device (e.g. mac mini, Nvidia DGX Spark, AMD Strix Halo)
- Huge jump in quality of **Opus 4.5+**, GPT 5.4 and Gemini 3
- **Open Source LLMs** are very close to top models:
  - GLM-5.3 and GLM-5.3-Flash (z.ai), Kimi K3 (Moonshot), MiMo 1.6 (Xiaomi - great and very cheap), Minimax M3, DeepSeek v4 Pro - best OSS models are all from China (updated 02.10.2026)
  - Best OSS for consumer hardware: Google [Gemma 4](https://ollama.com/library/gemma4), [Qwen 3.6](https://ollama.com/library/qwen3.6)
  - could be used also with Claude Code: [Ollama](https://docs.ollama.com/integrations/claude-code), [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/integrations/claude_code/) (good concurrency for scaling), [LocalAI](https://localai.io/integrations/index.html#claude-code)
  - **Tiny and local models as agent workers** (verified 2026-10-01): LFM2.5-350M (219 MB) handles extraction and simple tool calls; 8 GB laptop = `gemma4:e2b` or LFM2.5-350M, 16 GB = `gemma4:e4b` / `gemma4:12b` / `lfm2.5:8b`; run them as workers with `ollama launch claude` or `codex --oss` - sizes, benchmarks, configs: [local-models-as-agent-workers.md](Research/local-models-as-agent-workers.md)
  - **"Luna" as a subagent model = GPT-6 Luna (OpenAI)**: cheap high-volume tier (350-3,000 local messages per 5h on Plus), `codex -m gpt-6-luna` - details and Codex lineup: [token-optimization-limits-resets.md](Research/token-optimization-limits-resets.md#gpt-6-luna-as-a-subagent-model)
- **Screenshots** as a better way to provide context for vision models (less tokens thanks to compression, more information thanks to formatting, colors, images, etc.)
  - [DeepSeek OCR research paper on context compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18234)
  - [Andrej Karpathy on X.com](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1980397031542989305?lang=en) "whether pixels are better inputs to LLMs than text. Maybe it makes more sense that all inputs to LLMs should only ever be images"
- **Agents in the Cloud**
  - Delegating work to agents running 24/7 in the cloud, on VPS, or Codex/Claude/GH Environments
  - Case: [Levelsio runs agents on PROD VPS for >12 months](https://x.com/levelsio/status/2071162399864889705) + Theo's T3 thoughts about this
- **HTML replacing Markdown** - as more readable and interactive documents get easier to generate
  - You can start PRD, ADR or Plan with Markdown draft and ask agent to convert it to HTML
  - Example on feature branch in `/docs/PRD-Product-Requirements-Document.html`
- **AI disappointment**, broken promises, productivity drop, less fun and joy, frustration:
  - [AI Coding Sucks - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZUkQF6boNg)
  - undeterministic nature of LLMs,
  - hallucinations,
  - crazy pace of changes in AI tools,
  - skill degradation, vanishing muscle memory
    - AI detox

### Stages of AI-Assisted Programming (0 → 5):

| Stage | Name | Description | Who manages |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **0** | Manual | No AI — pure hand-written code | Developer writes everything |
| **1** | Autocomplete | AI tab completion (Copilot-style) | Developer drives, AI suggests |
| **2** | Chat | AI chat assistant — ask, copy-paste | Developer + AI pair |
| **3** | Agent | Full file edits, tools, AGENTS.md, MCP | Developer oversees one agent |
| **4** | Multi-Agent | Parallel agents, async cloud, CI/CD | Developer orchestrates a fleet |
| **5** | **Dark Factory** | Fully autonomous; humans manage specs, not code | Human defines *what*, agents decide *how* and *when* |

> **Dark Factory** (term borrowed from manufacturing — a factory floor that runs lights-out because no humans need to be present): applied to software, agents ship features 24/7, humans set direction, review specs, and handle escalations only.

### 3 New IT Roles in the Agentic Era:

1. **Orchestrators** — Manage fleets of agents, define tasks, review and steer output. Write less code and more context: AGENTS.md, PRDs, rules. The "new tech lead".
2. **System/Infrastructure Builders** — Build the scaffolding: CI/CD pipelines, MCP servers, agent sandboxes, observability, cost controls. Deep technical role that requires architecture thinking.
3. **Domain Experts as Programmers** — Subject-matter experts (lawyers, analysts, operations staff, doctors) who use natural language in Claude Code, Cursor or similar tools to produce working software. **They don't know they've become programmers** — they describe what they want in English and get working software. The most disruptive shift: an entirely new supply of "programmers" who never wrote a line of code.

### Future of work research (2026):

How AI changes developer careers - key insights from the 2026 future-of-work research (full report: [AI, przyszlosc pracy i nowy profil specjalisty - Research/ai_future_of_work_t_m_comb_shaped_report_2026.md](Research/ai_future_of_work_t_m_comb_shaped_report_2026.md)):

- **From T-shaped to M- and comb-shaped.** A T-shaped expert has one deep domain and a narrow strip of general skills. Working with agents widens several strips at once (M shape) and ties deep areas together with AI leverage (comb shape).
- **43,5%** of tasks performed with AI assistance traditionally belonged to a different occupation than the user's - specialization boundaries blur.
- **PwC, "rise of the generalist":** "AI can enable specialists to do so much they become generalists." What pays: judgment, prioritization, decision making, integration, ownership of the outcome.
- **Integrative generalist:** broad context + several real competences + AI leverage + judgment + ownership.
- **Microsoft Agent Boss loop:** define the goal -> break the problem down -> delegate to agents -> control -> integrate -> decide -> own the result.
- The three new roles above (Orchestrators, System/Infrastructure Builders, Domain Experts) are the career paths this research describes.

- **QUESTION:**
  - **Do you measure velocity / ROI / time estimations / Quality?** e.g.
  - Velocity in Jira with story points,
  - number of comments on CR,
  - number of issues/bugs/tickets,
  - it helps to measure AI impact on their work
- **The Productivity J-Curve** - productivity drops for 1-2 months when you learn

### Case Studies:

- **Microsoft: Galen Hunt's original ambition:** eliminate **every line of C/C++ from Microsoft by 2030**, using AI and algorithms to rewrite Microsoft's largest codebases in **Rust**. North Star: **1 engineer, 1 month, 1 million lines of code**; a scalable code graph guides agents making mass modifications. Hunt later clarified in the same post that this is a research project enabling language migration, not an announced AI rewrite of Windows.
  - Linkedin post from [Galen Hunt - Principal Software Engineer (CoreAI)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/galenh_principal-software-engineer-coreai-microsoft-activity-7407863239289729024-WTzf)
   My goal is to eliminate every line of C and C++ from Microsoft by 2030. Our strategy is to combine AI *and* Algorithms to rewrite Microsoft's largest codebases. Our North Star is "1 engineer, 1 month, 1 million lines of code".   To accomplish this previously unimaginable task, we've built a powerful code processing infrastructure. Our algorithmic infrastructure creates a scalable graph over source code at scale. Our AI processing infrastructure then enables us to apply AI agents, guided by algorithms, to make code modifications at scale. The core of this infrastructure is already operating at scale on problems such as code understanding.

- **OpenClaw** — fastest-growing GitHub project in history (launched late Nov 2025)
  - **220k+ Stars, 790 contributors, 4,300+ open PRs** — [github.com/openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)
  - Created by **Peter Steinberger** ([@steipete](https://github.com/steipete)), who joined **OpenAI in Feb 2026** to help build autonomous agents at scale. OpenClaw transitions to an OpenAI-backed open-source foundation.
  - **50+ parallel Codex agents for PR triage:** Peter spins up 50 Codex instances simultaneously, each outputs a JSON report (vision match, intent, risk signals). All 50 reports ingested in one session to query/deduplicate/auto-close/merge — no vector DB needed: [X post](https://x.com/steipete/status/2025591780595429385)
  - **GitHub activity at agent scale (updated 2026-10-05):** current trainer research identifies a record of about **6,700 on May 9, 2026**. The read-only GitHub contributions API verifies **6,747 total contributions and 1,089 commit contributions** on that date. Contributions include commits, pull requests and other activity; do not call the whole total commits. Peter regularly runs many agents across multiple projects.

First time thousands of *non-technical* people started using autonomous agents.
  - My 10-day experience report with exact token/cost/productivity numbers + notes on Opus 4.6 and GLM-4.7 (now GLM-5): [10 dni z OpenClaw — edukey.ai](https://edukey.ai/pl/blog/10-dni-z-openclaw-i-claude-opus-46-ai-rozwija-sie-szybciej-niz-twoj-zespol)

- **AI token budget: Jensen Huang (NVIDIA CEO), All-In Podcast, 19 March 2026.** For a software engineer or AI researcher earning **$500,000/year**, Huang expects **at least $250,000/year in tokens**, an additional company-funded AI budget equivalent to half the salary. This is an expectation/thought experiment, not verified actual expenditure or an ROI result. NVIDIA benefits commercially from AI infrastructure demand; this signals big-tech ambitions rather than a ready-made budget for a Polish company.
  - Primary publisher's [video clip and transcript](https://www.linkedin.com/videos/allinpod_jensen-huang-if-that-500000-engineer-activity-7440742599600230400-drTE); [full All-In interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwW8GKwHB3I).
  - Research checked 2026-10-06: the primary clip verifies Huang's statement. No equivalent half-salary primary statement from Satya Nadella was found; do not attribute the number to him. Reposts of Huang are not independent recommendations.

### AI real impact we already see in Dev/IT:

## AI Fundamentals

- **Knowledge Cutoff** - AI doesn't know latest versions & features of Tools/Languages
  - Better use **Java 21 (2023)** than 25 (07.2025)
  - Add context, docs for latest features
  - Overfitting - LLM may still struggle, ignore context and follow old path
- **Hallucinations**
  - RAG / Context / Browser helps to solve this issue, but not 100%
  - [AA-Omniscience Index](https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/omniscience) (Benchmark for Hallucination level)
  - [LogProbs parameter](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/using_logprobs/) (log probabilities of each output token)
- **Context Window**
  - Temporary "working memory" of LLM,
  - Attention (uwaga, skupienie),
  - Context Rot,
  - Lost in the Middle
- **Tokens**, Tokenizer, Embedding (osadzanie), Vector DB, etc.
  - Tokens are numeric IDs for pieces of text/data; an embedding lookup maps them to learned vectors. An ID is not itself a vector.
  - Practical trainer estimates (2026-10-05, tokenizer-dependent): **Polish around 2.4 tokens/word, English around 1.3; comparable Polish prose can use 60-80% more tokens**. Recommend English when practical to conserve context and token budget; Polish prompts can also lead to Polish reasoning traces. Quality effects depend on model/task, not a universal rule. [OpenAI Tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) | [Do Multilingual LLMs Think In English?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15603)
  - **Session context view (trainer-observed 2026-10-05):** Claude Code and Copilot CLI show a detailed breakdown with `/context`. Codex CLI has basic `/status` and account-wide `/usage` analytics, not an equivalent session breakdown. **ChatGPT Desktop app, Codex mode** (Codex merged into the ChatGPT app): **Settings > General > Composer > Show context window usage**; availability has been unstable; the post-merge report includes an October 2026 reproduction even with the setting enabled. This is a Codex-session indicator; equivalent behavior in Work mode is unconfirmed. [OpenAI merger announcement](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-for-your-most-ambitious-work/) | [Indicator regression report](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/32104). [Copilot context management](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/copilot-cli/context-management) | [Codex commands](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/slash-commands)

- **Autoregression**
  - model predicts future values in a sequence by using a linear combination of its own past values
  - one mistake may lead to cascade / domino effect of mistakes (better to start again - branching in ChatGPT, Cursor can also revert with back icon next to our prompts in history)
- What LLM needs to support to use it as **AI Agent**:
  - **Structured Output** / Json schema:
    - [OpenAI Structured Outputs Guide (JavaScript)](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs/?lang=javascript)
    - [OpenAI Java SDK Examples (structured output at the end of the list)](https://github.com/openai/openai-java/tree/332e1a18b4a11469e528f0359c997ae2beecd04a/openai-java-example/src/main/java/com/openai/example)
    - [Spring AI – OpenAI Structured Outputs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/chat/openai-chat.html#_structured_outputs)
  - **Function Calling** / Tool usage
- **RAG** - architecture / concept of augmenting context / input with real data
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (creator regrets this name ;)
  - Semantic search in vector space, Vector DB, Graph DB, Hybrid
  - Reranking
    - [Vercel AI SDK – Reranking](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-core/reranking)
  - Local Vector DBs:
    - [SQLite Vector Extension](https://www.sqlite.ai/sqlite-vector)
    - [Chroma – Open-source Embedding Database](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma)
- **Cache** - cost optimization, caching calculated weights for same input tokens
- **Reasoning**, Reinforced Learning & R1:
  - [How was DeepSeek-R1 built; For dummies : r/LLMDevs](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1ibhpqw/how_was_deepseekr1_built_for_dummies/)
  - It changed a lot in AI, enabled Vibe Coding, Autonomus Agents
  - Should we always use reasoning models??? :)
- **System 1 models (Jev)** - new model class between big LLMs and classic ML classifiers: fast, cheap, calibrated typed judgments (routing, triage, classification) instead of a full LLM call; TypeSafe launched Jev 15.09.2026 - details, trade-offs, JevBench: [system-1-models-jev.md](Research/system-1-models-jev.md)
- **Types of AI Assistance** in programming (quick history):
  - **autocomplete** (starting from [Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/), GH Copilot, now Cursor Tab [based on Supermaven](https://supermaven.com/blog/cursor-announcement))
  - Chat / Research / Talk about your code
  - Inline Generation
  - Code Generation, planning, TODOs, Tools, MCPs, etc.
  - **Agentic workflows**, local task automation, loops, goals (not only codding):

### Copilot in VS Code - Autopilot, Assisted Permissions, Subagents (group questions, verified 2026-10-01)

- **Autopilot / Allow all**: `chat.tools.global.autoApprove` (renamed in v1.104 from `chat.tools.autoApprove`, no migration); Autopilot (Preview) auto-approves tools and keeps working until done - skips confirmation for destructive actions and consumes AI credits
- **Assisted permissions** (experimental, `chat.assistedPermissions.enabled`): an LLM judge rates the risk of each tool call, Agent Host sessions only; in Copilot CLI: `/permissions assisted`
- **Copilot CLI subagents**: `/tasks` (tree of subagents, teleport into one), `/subagents` (model per agent), `/fleet` (parallel execution)
- **Can everything from the course run in VS Code?** Almost: Claude Code in VS Code is the same CLI; Copilot has agent modes + `runSubagent`; headless CI, worktree fleets with a multiplexer and Beads stay in the terminal

## Pricing - rate limits

[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/8a4739c4-f9b3-41a2-aaf0-612daa0750ce) on pricing of main AI Coding tools
[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/ddbe409f-832b-4d19-ac7d-aed2e059d2c2) on pricing & quality of OpenSource Models (GLM/ M2) vs big providers

- **Google Gemini AI Pro** plan with CLI / Code Assist / Antigravity:
  - on Pro: 120 requests/m, 1500 r/day - [Quotas and limits  |  Gemini Code Assist ](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/resources/quotas)
  - Antigravity on Pro "high generous quota refreshed every 5h": [Google Antigravity Quota](https://antigravity.google/docs/plans)
- **JetBrains** AI Assistant has only 10 credits for $10 = around 100 requests/month
  - [Licensing and subscriptions | AI Assistant Documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ai-assistant/licensing-and-subscriptions.html#individual-use)
- **Claude Code Pro** ($17-20/m) & Max ($100 5x, $200 20x Pro) plans:
  - [Pricing | Claude](https://claude.com/pricing)
- **GitHub Copilot** 
  - Free: 50 premium requests/m + 2000 completions (NO: CLI, PRs, issue assign,  code reviews)
  - Pro for $10/m - unlimited GPT-5.4 mini, 300 premium requests (also Opus 4.5+)
  - Pro+ for $39/m - 1500 premium requests
  - [GitHub Copilot · Plans & pricing · GitHub](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans)
  - [Plans for GitHub Copilot - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/plans) (detailed docs)
- **Cursor Pro** for $20/m provides best autocomplete
  - [Pricing · Cursor](https://cursor.com/pricing)
- **ChatGPT Plus** for $20/m
  - provides access to **Codex** (both CLI and Cloud agents with GitHub integration)
- **GLM Codding Plan**
  - GLM-5.3 (and the faster GLM-5.3-Flash) is probably the best open source Coding LLM (some argue that M2.7 is better/faster)
  - Lite plan may be slow but costs only $3/m and offers 3x usage of Claude Code Pro!
  - Pro plan is for $12 for the first year, $30/m later (5x Lite plan = 15x Claude Code Pro)
    Video on GLM-5 and Minimax M2.7: [So close to Opus at 1/10th the price (GLM-4.7 and Minimax M2.1 showdown) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEPLuEjVr_4)
  - Invite link with additional 10%: https://z.ai/subscribe?ic=IA5VBRGQV4
  - ⚠️ **UPDATE 01.10.2026**: z.ai restructured pricing around GLM-5.3 - docs now say "starting at 18 USD/mo" with a credits system (Lite 2,000/5h + 10,000 weekly, Pro 12,000/60,000, Max 28,000/140,000 credits), older GLM-5.2/5.1 auto-routed to GLM-5.3, off-peak = 50% credits: [z.ai devpack docs](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/overview). Re-check before quoting the $3/$12 prices above
- **MiniMax** - M2.1/M2.5 API $0.30/$1.20 per M tokens; Token Plan Plus $20/m, Max $50/m, Ultra $120/m; [M Plan](https://www.minimax.io/m-plan) annual from $220/yr with MiniMax Code agent included. Cheapest per-token coding workhorse, fast (M2.7): [YT showdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEPLuEjVr_4) (verified 01.10.2026)
- **Kimi (Moonshot)** - K3 flagship (~$3/$15 per M via gateways), K2.7 Code better value for long coding sessions; Kimi Code membership tiers (Allegretto $39/m); K3 subscriptions sold out at one point due to demand - [pricing guide](https://felloai.com/kimi-pricing), [docs](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en). Top-tier agentic coder, watch availability (verified 01.10.2026)
- **DeepSeek** - official API pricing (01.10.2026): `deepseek-v4-pro` (1M ctx) $0.66-1.32 input / $1.98-3.96 output per M; `deepseek-flash` (V4.1-Flash, 1M ctx) $0.15-0.30 input / $0.60-1.20 output; off-peak half price - [pricing](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing). Cheapest flagship-tier API with 1M context; no flat-rate subscription, so no Claude Code-style plan - pay per token
- **Tetrate.ai** $15 for free (OpenRouter for Enterprise):
  - 1. Create account for $5 free: [Tetrate: Safe, Fast, and Profitable AI for the Enterprise](https://tetrate.io/)
  - 2. Use goose CLI to add Tetrate Agent Router for $10 more: [Quickstart | goose](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/quickstart/)

### TOKEN OPTIMIZATION - limits, resets, cheaper models (verified 01.10.2026)

- **Claude Pro/Max**: rolling 5-hour window + weekly limit at the same time; the 5h window starts on your first prompt, so the **6am trick** (scheduled throwaway prompt) works; check `/usage`
- **Banked resets are granted, not bought** (model releases, incidents; redeem within about a month): Codex, and Claude since the Opus 5.5 release (end of 09.2026); paid options = Claude usage credits, Codex paid instant reset
- **Strategy**: burn the weekly allowance to zero first, then apply the reset (effectively 2x for that week)
- **Cheaper models as workers**: GPT-6 Luna, local LFM2.5 / Gemma 4 / Qwen 3.6, Chinese APIs (MiniMax, Kimi, DeepSeek, MiMo)
- Full numbers (Codex 5h ranges per model), auto-continue, how to save the allowance, sources: [token-optimization-limits-resets.md](Research/token-optimization-limits-resets.md)

## My Recommendations - tools to install/use:

- **Handy STT** (like SuperWhisper but Open Source MIT)
  - [Handy](https://handy.computer/)
  - architecture details (Tauri): [Code Wiki](https://codewiki.google/github.com/cjpais/handy)
- Claude Code - for multi-step tasks, leading in innovation, and access to best models on discounted prices (especially on Max plan)
  - Desktop & Mobile apps with Code Agent in the cloud! [Claude Desktop App](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/desktop)
  - ⚠️ **Anthropic API / Claude Code availability** — in the last months, uptime has sometimes dropped below 99% for 90 day window. When you see below API errors, check [status.claude.com](https://status.claude.com/):
    - `● API Error: 529 Overloaded` — server-side overload, usually temporary — try again in a moment
    - `● API Error: 500 Internal server error` — server-side issue, usually temporary — try again in a moment
    - If either persists, check https://status.claude.com
- Codex - for very high limits, best models for hard work (not as good as Opus in architecture, but great for development and more focused), good cloud agents with GitHub integration.
- Zed.ai - to use any AI tool/Provider you wont, Open Source, Rust (fast)
- Cursor - for best autocomplete and cloud agents, RAG on any docs
- GitHub Copilot - for integration with JetBrains IDEs, access to many models, good Cloud Agent (GH native), best Code Reviews online, and good price.
- Google AI Pro - not best for programming, but best value for money overall: Gemini App, Gmail, Docs + Gemini CLI + Antigravity + Code Assist + Veo + ...
  - NotebookLM for learning / knowledge base: [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/)
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) for control, observability and 1 API Key for all tools
- [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) Agent for programming, PC control & automation workflows
  - Advent of AI: [Advent of AI](https://adventofai.dev/) (by Goose)

## AI Agents Tool-belt:

### Rules

- custom prompts/instructions per folder / type of file (with regex):
  - Cursor, GitHub Copilot & Claude Code has path based targeting e.g. `"src/api/**/*.ts"`
  - in Cluade Code: [Path Specific Rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#path-specific-rules)
  - in Cursor: [Rules | Cursor Docs](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules)
  - in OpenCode: [Rules | OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/rules/)
  - in Codex CLI: [Rules](https://developers.openai.com/codex/rules)
  - examples:
    - [payload/templates/website/.cursor/rules at main · payloadcms/payload · GitHub](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/website/.cursor/rules)

### Config files & Permissions (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot - verified 2026-10-01)

- **Claude Code**: `permissions` block in `settings.json` with `allow` / `ask` / `deny`, evaluated deny > ask > allow (an allow can't punch a hole in a deny); files: managed > `--settings` > `.claude/settings.local.json` > `.claude/settings.json` > `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Codex**: `approval_policy` + `sandbox_mode` in `config.toml`; allow/deny specific commands with Starlark **rules** in `~/.codex/rules/` or `<repo>/.codex/rules/` (most restrictive wins)
- **Copilot CLI**: saved approvals in `~/.copilot/permissions-config.json` (allow only); deny with `--deny-tool` flags (deny always wins) and `deniedUrls`
- Full syntax, examples and sources: [config-files-and-permissions.md](Research/config-files-and-permissions.md)
- Example files in this repo:
  - Claude Code: [project `.claude/settings.json`](../.claude/settings.json) (allow/deny + pom.xml security hook), [`agent-configs/claude/settings.json`](agent-configs/claude/settings.json), commented version with the reasoning behind each rule: [`agent-configs/claude/settings.jsonc`](agent-configs/claude/settings.jsonc)
  - Codex: [project `.codex/config.toml`](../.codex/config.toml) (`approval_policy`, `sandbox_mode`, network), Java/Spring variant: [`agent-configs/codex/config.toml`](agent-configs/codex/config.toml)
  - Copilot CLI: `--allow-tool` / `--deny-tool` flags in [`agent-configs/copilot/start-copilot.sh`](agent-configs/copilot/start-copilot.sh) and [`start-copilot.ps1`](agent-configs/copilot/start-copilot.ps1)
  - Hooks that block secrets in all three tools: [`hooks-example/`](hooks-example/)

### AGENTS.md

Custom project file (or many nested files) with instructions and description of application or it's parts:
  - Growing standard: [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/)
  - CLAUDE.md [CLAUDE.MD files: Customizing Claude Code for your codebase | Claude](https://claude.com/blog/using-claude-md-files)
  - GEMINI.md [Provide context with GEMINI.md files | Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/gemini-md/)
  - **Claude Code reads AGENTS.md natively (v2.1.277+, 2026)**: [How Claude remembers your project](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory)
    - **Precedence when both exist**: CLAUDE.md (also `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`) in the working dir or any parent **wins by default**; AGENTS.md is read only when none of those exist
    - Change in `/config` -> **Project instructions**: `claude-md-or-agents-md` (default) | `claude-md-and-agents-md` (both, CLAUDE.md first) | `claude-md` | `managed-only` (org instructions only)
    - Portable trick: one-line `CLAUDE.md` containing `@AGENTS.md` imports it for Claude AND other tools read the AGENTS.md directly
    - Verify what was loaded: `/memory` (AGENTS.md appears in the list); `/context` shows its token cost
    - Files over 200 lines "consume more context and may reduce adherence"; hard cap 4 MiB; use `.claude/rules/` path-scoped rules instead of one giant file
  - Discussions / Sources:
    - X.com thread: [Matt Pocock](https://x.com/mattpocockuk/status/2012906065856270504)
    - Article & Prompt to fix AGENTS.md: [A Complete Guide To AGENTS.md](https://www.aihero.dev/a-complete-guide-to-agents-md)
  - Examples:
    - [mcp-for-beginners/AGENTS.md at main · microsoft/mcp-for-beginners · GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp-for-beginners/blob/main/AGENTS.md) (includes Java Spring Boot)
    - [payload/templates/website/AGENTS.md at main · payloadcms/payload · GitHub](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/templates/website/AGENTS.md)

### Claude Code: enterprise (managed) settings vs your config

- Org-wide `managed-settings.json` (highest precedence, users can't override) can enforce permission rules, models, hooks, MCP servers and block bypass mode
- Your CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md can't be blocked by default; only an explicit org setting (`instructionFiles: "managed-only"`) leaves them out
- Paths per OS, full key list, how to check what applied: [config-files-and-permissions.md](Research/config-files-and-permissions.md#claude-code-enterprise-managed-settings-vs-your-config)

### SKILLS.md

- What are Skills:
  - [GitHub - agentskills/agentskills: Specification and documentation for Agent Skills](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills)
  - [Overview - Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home)
- **skills.sh** - Library of Skills & "skill manager" tool from Vercel: [The Agent Skills Directory](https://skills.sh/)
  - **Does skills.sh install plugins? NO (verified 01.10.2026)** - the `skills` CLI ([vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)) installs **skills only** (SKILL.md instruction files): `add`, `use`, `list`, `find`, `remove`, `update`, `init`; ~80 agents supported. Partial plugin compatibility: if a repo has `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, the **skills declared in those manifests** are discovered and installable - but the plugin itself (commands, agents, hooks, MCP config) is not. Full plugin install stays with the agents' own mechanisms (e.g. Claude Code `claude plugin`, Codex `codex plugin marketplace add`)
- **NEW TREND: Skills over MCP** - an MCP server serves skills and the agent loads them on demand, so they are always up to date (no `skills update` in every repo). Official MCP extension `io.modelcontextprotocol/skills`, [SEP-2640](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/seps/2640-skills-extension) final since 13 Sep 2026; client support is still rolling out: [Skills over MCP Working Group](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/working-groups/skills-over-mcp), [spec & implementations](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-skills)
- Our public skills (PRD, ADR, design system, code review responses): [EdukeyTeam/agent-toolbox](https://github.com/EdukeyTeam/agent-toolbox) - install with `npx skills add EdukeyTeam/agent-toolbox --skill write-prd`
- Skills in popular tools (docs):

### Custom Slash Commands / Prompts

**Custom slash commands** (in Claude Code) or **Custom Prompts** (in Codex) are simple reusable prompts (Markdown files) you invoke manually via `/command-name` (optionally with an extra message/argument). They are the lightweight sibling of Skills — no metadata, no auto-triggering. You write the prompt once and reuse it on demand.

- **What they are:** Markdown files stored in `.claude/commands/` (Claude Code CLI, Claude Code Desktop app, or Agent SDK). Each file becomes a `/`-command. You can optionally pass `$ARGUMENTS` to inject a custom message at invocation time.
- **When to use Commands vs Skills:**
  - Use **Custom Commands** for *simpler, reusable prompts* you want to trigger *explicitly* (e.g. a commit-message generator, a code-review checklist, a fixed prompt template). Lower overhead, no triggering heuristics.
  - Use **Skills** when the agent should *auto-detect* context and pull instructions in (via the `description` field), when you need to split knowledge/instructions in multiple files, or when you want bundled assets or scripts.
- **Grouping (optional):** Placing commands in a subfolder creates a `group:name` namespace. E.g. `.claude/commands/git/commit.md` is invoked as `/git:commit`.
- Docs in Claude Agent SDK (same mechanism for Claude Code CLI & Desktop app): [Creating custom slash commands](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/slash-commands#creating-custom-slash-commands)
- Docs in Codex (DEPRECATED, use skills instead): [Custom Prompts](https://developers.openai.com/codex/custom-prompts)
- Example commands in this repo: [`/.claude/commands/`](../.claude/commands/) — grouped under [`git/`](../.claude/commands/git):
  - [`git/commit.md`](../.claude/commands/git/commit.md) → invoked as `/git:commit`
  - [`git/diff.md`](../.claude/commands/git/diff.md) → invoked as `/git:diff`

### Hooks

Scripts the agent harness runs on lifecycle events (session start, before/after a tool call, prompt submit, stop). A `PreToolUse` hook gets the planned tool call as JSON and can **deny** it (exit code `2`), rewrite its arguments or log it. Narrow a hook with a `matcher` (tool name regex), in Claude Code also with `if` (permission-rule syntax, e.g. `Bash(git commit *)`), or inside the script (check the file path / command).

- Copilot (CLI, cloud agent, VS Code preview): `.github/hooks/*.json` - [Hooks](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/hooks), [reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/hooks-reference), [VS Code hooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/hooks)
- Claude Code: `.claude/settings.json` - [Hooks guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide)
- Codex: `.codex/hooks.json` (trust once with `/hooks`) - [Hooks](https://developers.openai.com/codex/hooks)
- Example in this repo: one script that blocks `.env`, `secrets/` and SSH keys in all three tools: [`hooks-example/`](hooks-example/)

### Statusline (Claude Code)

- Custom status line under the prompt: `statusLine` in settings.json runs your script after each turn with session JSON on stdin, no API tokens: [Statusline docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline)
- Easiest: type `/statusline show model name and context percentage` and Claude Code writes the script for you
- Full example in this repo (git branch, context bar, cost, Pro/Max 5h + weekly usage): [`agent-configs/claude/statusline.sh`](agent-configs/claude/statusline.sh), wired in [`agent-configs/claude/settings.json`](agent-configs/claude/settings.json)
- Minimal manual setup and stdin JSON fields: [config-files-and-permissions.md](Research/config-files-and-permissions.md#statusline-claude-code)

### Tools

- built-in Agent tools (provided by IDE / CLI you use):
  - Terminal
  - Browse / Search
  - Docs (RAG) lub Contex7 MCP jeśli nie ma docs wbudowanych
  - Codebase index / semantic search (RAG over your repo): Cursor and Copilot (`#codebase`; remote index for GitHub/Azure DevOps repos, local index elsewhere, off by default for org accounts): [Copilot semantic search](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agents/reference/workspace-context#_semantic-search). Less critical than a year ago: agents find code well with plain grep/ripgrep
  - GIT
  - TODO list
  - Browser integration (e.g. in Cursor) / Chrome-devtools-mcp
  - + Custom Tools
- **LSP** (Language Server Protocol)
  - allows agent to use diagnostic tools and understand syntax, linting errors

### MCP - Tools & Servers

- MCP (Model Context Protocol)
  - open standard for anybody to build tools for agents
  - best suited for accessing external services (as MCP Servers, or **Connectors**)
  - but there are also local MCP tools available (e.g. Playwright)
  - Anthropic's Skill to build own MCP Tools: [MCP Builder](https://www.skills.sh/anthropics/skills/mcp-builder)
- Problems:
  - Context bloating = Context rot,
    - partially fixed by [Tool Discovery](https://modelcontextprotocol.info/docs/concepts/tools/#tool-discovery-and-updates) = 1 tool to rule them all
  - Too many choices for agent (max 5x MCP servers / 50 tools in total used at once!)
  - Slower than just Bash scripts, terminal commands (Agent also can use them!)
  - Sometimes CLI tool is better (with optional skill how to use it), e.g.
    - [Sentry CLI](https://cli.sentry.dev/)
    - [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/quickstart)
    - [Playwright CLI](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli) + [Skill](https://www.skills.sh/microsoft/playwright-cli/playwright-cli)
- History of the Standard
  - Introduced by Anthropic in 2024: [Introducing the Model Context Protocol \\ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)
  - Donated to Linux Foundation subsidiary: [Donating the MCP and the Agentic AI Foundation](https://www.anthropic.com/news/donating-the-model-context-protocol-and-establishing-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation)
  - Open Standard: [What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)? - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro)
  - Why MCP moved from SSE to Streamable HTTP: [SSE vs. Streamable HTTP - which will be the standard for remote servers? : r/mcp](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1kdyse2/sse_vs_streamable_http_which_will_be_the_standard/)
- **NEW TREND: WebMCP** - a web page declares its own tools for agents (annotated HTML forms or `navigator.modelContext.registerTool()` in JS). Instead of slow, token-hungry DOM traversal and clicking, the agent does complex actions with a few tool calls. Chrome 149 origin trial, locally via `chrome://flags/#enable-webmcp-testing`: [WebMCP in Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/webmcp)
  - Example: [Stack Underflow](https://devpost.com/software/stack-underflow-your-ai-agent-plays-in-the-office) (my OpenAI WebMCP Challenge game, the browser agent plays as an office coworker) - [play it](https://play.devpowers.com)

### ACP (Agent Client Protocol)

- use CLI Agents in other tools / IDEs
  - Created by Zed IDE to use Claude Code in Zed (now also for Codex, Gemini, OpenCode)
  - in ZED [Zed — Agent Client Protocol](https://zed.dev/acp)
  - in JetBrains IDEs: [Agent Client Protocol | JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ai-assistant/acp.html#install-agent-from-registry)
  - in OpenCode: [ACP Support | OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/acp/)
  - in Goose: [Using goose in ACP Clients | goose](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/acp-clients)

### Sub-Agents

Main agent can delegate tasks to sub-agents (often specialized), to focus on orchestration, minimize context window bloat and work in parallel (often faster).

- In most popular tools:
  - Claude Code: [Create custom subagents - Claude Code Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)
    - [Agent Teams (experimental feature) vs Sub-Agents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams)
    - [Blog: Subagents in Claude Code](https://claude.com/blog/subagents-in-claude-code)
  - Codex CLI [Multi-agents](https://developers.openai.com/codex/multi-agent/) - the user-facing command is **`/subagents`** (see the supervision layers below)
  - Google Antigravity [Subagents](https://antigravity.google/docs/subagents)
  - Cursor: [Subagents | Cursor Docs](https://cursor.com/docs/context/subagents)
  - Copilot: [About custom agents - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-custom-agents)
  - OpenCode: [Agents | OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/)
  - Goose: [Subagents | goose](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/subagents/)
- Nested Sub-Agents (sub-agents spawned by sub-agents):
  - [Claude Code - Nested Sub-Agents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents#spawn-nested-subagents) (max depth is 5, not configurable)
  - [Codex Subagent settings](https://developers.openai.com/codex/subagents#global-settings) - `agent.max_threads` is now a **legacy alias** of `agents.max_concurrent_threads_per_session` (default **4** as of CLI 0.159.3, was 6) & `agent.max_depth` (default: 1 - only main agent can spawn sub-agents, set to 2+ to allow nested sub-agents)
- **Codex CLI: two layers of multi-agent supervision** (verified 2026-10-01, CLI 0.159.3):
  - **Agent Command Center** (shipped 0.149.0, 2026-08-20): open with **`codex agents`** from the shell or **`/agents`** in a session - a dashboard over **top-level sessions/tasks**: search, start, open, rename, stop, filter, archive/delete, plus **Git worktree** management: [release notes](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.149.0), [docs](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/subagents)
    - same release added **`codex queue`** - send a message to an existing local or remote Codex session (even when it is not in the foreground)
  - **`/subagents`** - the Subagents picker **inside the current session**: switch between and inspect the agent threads the current root agent spawned (internally named `MultiAgents` in source - the old docs name "Multi-agents" maps to the user-facing command **`/subagents`**; current docs say `/agent` singular, docs slightly ahead of stable - UNCONFIRMED)
  - Mental model for teaching: **Agent Command Center manages jobs, `/subagents` inspects the workers inside a job**
- **Git Worktrees** for Parallel Agents in same repository:
  - What is a Git Worktree? [Git Worktree Docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree)
  - Claude: [Run parallel Claude code sessions with Git worktrees | Claude Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows#run-parallel-claude-code-sessions-with-git-worktrees)
  - Codex: [Worktrees | OpenAI Codex Docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app/worktrees/)
  - Cursor: [Parallel Agents | Cursor Docs](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/worktrees)
  - Avoid a full `node_modules` install per worktree: pnpm global virtual store (`virtualStoreType: global` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`), each worktree only links into one shared store: [pnpm + git worktrees](https://pnpm.io/git-worktrees)

### Agent managers / multiplexers - work with many agents at once (links verified 01.10.2026)

- **[Herdr](https://herdr.dev)** - open-source terminal multiplexer for agents: vendor-neutral, tracks agent state (idle/working/blocked/done), survives lost SSH
- **[Beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads)** - git-backed issue tracker as shared memory for agents (Steve Yegge)
- **[Paseo](https://paseo.sh)**, **[Orca](https://www.onorca.dev)**, **[T3 Code](https://t3.codes)**, **[Conductor](https://conductor.build)**, **[Vibe Kanban](https://www.vibekanban.com)** - orchestrators / control planes for parallel agents; **[Codex App](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app)** - OpenAI's single-vendor desktop app
- **Herdr vs Codex App**: vendor-neutral runtime on your own machines vs zero-ops, OpenAI-only app with cloud tasks - they combine well
- **Remote agents**: `herdr --machine <label>` over SSH, Codex cloud tasks, `codex exec`, `codex agents` + `codex queue`

- https://github.com/luongnv89/claude-howto/blob/main/claude_concepts_guide.md#plugins

## Security

- Validate skills, MCPs and any scripts before installing and using them.
- Check the license for skills, hooks and agents you copy from internet (e.g. Anthropic skills are not permissive) - license can be found on GitHub repo or inside skill folder.
- YOLO MODE requires good sandboxing or phisical 2nd device without sensitive credentials.

## Best Practices / Methodologies for Agentic Codding:

- Plan & Solve
- Plan-Execute-Test-Commit loop
- Good AGENTS.md and rules for better understanding of the project
- Make AI Agent ask you questions instead of acting immediately (Custom agent or in AGENTS.md)
  - With better initial prompt and info Agent will not interrupt you so often and work longer
  - **Codex: interactive questions OUTSIDE plan mode** (verified 2026-10-01, CLI 0.159.3):
    - The interactive questions UI (clickable options) is **plan mode only**: [Plan mode](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plan-mode) - toggle with `/plan` or **Shift+Tab**; "Plan mode lets Codex gather context, ask clarifying questions, and build a stronger plan"
    - Outside plan mode: **no built-in "ask user" tool** yet - open feature request: [GitHub issue #30150](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/30150) (since 2026-06-26)
    - Workaround 1 - prompting: ask Codex to **interview you** before acting (official suggestion in [Best practices](https://learn.chatgpt.com/guides/best-practices)), or add one line to AGENTS.md like "Before implementing, ask me clarifying questions until requirements are unambiguous" - questions arrive as plain text, not the structured UI: [r/codex thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/codex/comments/1vdo16g/adding_this_one_line_allows_your_codex_to_ask/)
    - Workaround 2 (official, structured): **MCP elicitation** - an MCP server can ask the user structured questions mid-tool-call (`mcpServer/elicitation/request`); enable with `approval_policy.granular.mcp_elicitations = true` in config.toml: [Config reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference), [MCP app-server docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server)

- Architecture Decision Records (ADR): **give the agent links to the libraries and APIs you consider.** Without them it often misses new options and falls back to outdated patterns from training data. Adding [Chat SDK](https://chat-sdk.dev/), [OpenRouter Responses API](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api_reference/responses/overview) and [OpenRouter + Vercel AI SDK](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/community/vercel-ai-sdk) changed our ADR a lot: [example prompt](Prompt%20examples/ADR-generation-typescript-vercel-ai-sdk.md)

- **Community PR-Agent 0.47.0:** ready-made review/describe/improve workflows, with a [ready exercise and examples for GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, Bamboo, Gitea and a local run](cicd-headless/PR-Agent-Qodo/README.md); Git hosting and CI runner are separate choices. Pipeline execution publishes comments; slash commands need a comment-event listener/webhook.
- **Codex directly in Bitbucket + Jira:** [headless pipeline and custom REST adapter](cicd-headless/codex-bitbucket/README.md) - fetch PR diff and ticket details, request a schema-validated review, then update bot comments in both systems. Separate context, model and publication stages; no Qodo/PR-Agent dependency. This example targets Cloud APIs; Server/DC needs a different adapter.
- Headless commands: `copilot -p`, `claude -p`, `codex exec`, `opencode run` (also `agy -p`, `grok -p`)
  - deep dive (validated 01.10.2026): [Research/Headless agents - CLI automation, JSON streaming, subscriptions and CI-CD](Research/Headless%20agents%20-%20CLI%20automation,%20JSON%20streaming,%20subscriptions%20and%20CI-CD.md) - JSON event streams, JSON Schema output, subscription vs API billing per tool, CI/CD patterns, security rules
  - **JSON event streams** (newline-delimited): `claude -p --output-format stream-json` | `codex exec --json` | `agy -p --output-format stream-json` | `grok -p --output-format streaming-json` (different spelling!) | `copilot -p --output-format json` | `opencode run --format json`
  - **JSON Schema final output** (validated, not just "please respond with JSON"): Claude `--json-schema`, Codex `--output-schema <file>`, Antigravity `--json-schema`; Grok/Copilot CLI expose events only (validate yourself, e.g. Zod); OpenCode via SDK `json_schema`
  - **Claude `--bare`**: skips hooks, skills, MCP, plugins, CLAUDE.md discovery = deterministic CI mode (recommended by Anthropic for scripts/SDK), but does NOT use subscription OAuth - needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; also the safe choice in untrusted repos (`-p` loads project config without showing the trust dialog)
  - **Env trap**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in the environment overrides the subscription even in `-p` mode - `unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to go back to subscription billing
  - Budgets/limits: `copilot -p --max-ai-credits 50` (1 credit = $0.01, soft cap), `grok --max-turns`, plus your own orchestrator timeouts
- One `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` can drive all four (Copilot CLI BYOK via `COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL`); Copilot on its own account needs a user-owned fine-grained PAT with **Copilot Requests**: [Copilot CLI programmatically](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/automate-copilot-cli/run-cli-programmatically), [Codex non-interactive](https://developers.openai.com/codex/noninteractive), [Claude Code headless](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/headless)
- CI image: Debian slim, not Alpine (agent CLIs expect glibc). Bitbucket app passwords stopped working in July 2026, use access/API tokens

   - **Qodo** - [commercial AI code review platform](https://www.qodo.ai/), separate from the community open-source project. Qodo [announced the PR-Agent handover on 23 April 2026](https://www.qodo.ai/blog/qodo-is-handing-pr-agent-over-to-the-community/).
   - **Community PR-Agent** - [The-PR-Agent/pr-agent](https://github.com/The-PR-Agent/pr-agent), MIT, community-owned and maintained independently of Qodo; latest release checked 02.10.2026: [v0.47.0](https://github.com/The-PR-Agent/pr-agent/releases/tag/v0.47.0). Use [community docs](https://docs.pr-agent.ai/), rather than assuming commercial Qodo features exist in OSS.
     - Supports GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud/Server/DC, Azure DevOps and Gitea; tool and inline-comment support vary by provider: [platform matrix](https://docs.pr-agent.ai/overview/supported_platforms/).
     - [`qodo-pr-agent-review.yml`](cicd-headless/github-actions/qodo-pr-agent-review.yml) retains its historical filename but now uses the community runtime; manual dispatch accepts a PR number and calls the CLI. [Multi-platform examples](cicd-headless/PR-Agent-Qodo/README.md).
